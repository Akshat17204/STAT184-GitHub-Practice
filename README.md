# GitHub Setup and Practice Assignment

**(10 points) Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (very useful to include on job or graduate school applications)  
- Create a new repository & initialize it with a "readme"   
- Turn your repository into a website  
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> create website from master branch  
    - choose a style template 
    - note the website url  
    - modify content if you like, but it's fine to use filler/default content provided for now  
- Locate class repository for this assignment
    - Find "sayaliph" in GitHub and locate the "STAT184-GitHub-Practice" repository through my account
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- **Add a row** in the table below with your information 
    - follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (next to the "]" key)... use the "Sayali Phadke" row as a template
    - (2 points) first & last name  
    - (1 point)  class day and time
    - (2 points) github id  
    - (2 points) url for GitHub Pages website generated from your GitHub repo  
            - by default it will include "[userID].github.io" at the beginning  
            - it's **NOT** just the URL of the source repo itself  
    - (2 points) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckman to class table")  
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - (1 point) make sure the link works (e.g., wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
    - (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
    - **Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away. Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
